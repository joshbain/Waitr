# Waitr Coding Challenge

**Total Development Time:** 57 hours (including all research and developemnt as well as documentation, deployment, etc)

## Overview

The server-side solution was developed using node.js, swagger-codgen and mysql-model and their prerequistes.  
The client-side code was developed using the usual suspects, jquery, font-awesome, bootstrap, and knockout as well as dropzone.
The purely objective data (the information on the driver and the deliveries) is stored in a mysql database while all of the 
information that the server uses to produce it's recomendations is stored locally in memory and regenerated if the service is restarted.
